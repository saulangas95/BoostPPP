## 📁 Included Scripts

This repository contains all scripts required to reproduce the simulation and numerical results presented in the article.

| Script | Related Figure(s) | Description |
|--------|-------------------|-------------|
| `TransferFunctions_KERS.m` | Fig. 5 | Computes transfer functions from vehicle speed (km/h) to generator input speed (rpm) and output voltage (V). Includes step response plots for four velocity profiles. |
| `flywheel.m` | Fig. 6 (a, b, c) | Calculates mass, moment of inertia, and stored kinetic energy for five flywheel design cases. Generates bar plots comparing steel and aluminum options. |
| `senales.m` | Fig. 9 (a, b, c, d) | Loads waveform data from `Graf-KERs.xlsx` and plots four time-domain signals: input current, inductor currents, output current, and output voltage. |
